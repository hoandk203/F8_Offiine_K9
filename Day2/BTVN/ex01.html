                This week I am extremely excited about cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerde the food(usually vacuum
                sealed in plastic) into a wter bath thar is aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,
                Cooking fir Geeks, Jeff Potter describes ir as " ultra-low temperature poaching".
